When the user clicks on the Generate Password button, the first prompt asks the user how many characters (between 8-128) they want their password to be.

If a user selects a number less than 8, a number greater than 128, presses Cancel (resulting in a NULL), or enters a non-umeric character, the prompt will refresh again and will continue to do so until the user selects a number between 8-128.

After indicating a number betwenn 8-128, the user will be asked a series of prompts asking if they'd like to use lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, or special characters in their password. Clicking OK means the user does, and clicking CANCEL means they do not.

If a user clicks CANCEL for all 4 prompts, they will receive an alert that says they must select at least one of the criteria. When the user clicks OK, the page will return to the original state and the user can start over by clicking Generate Password.

Once the user has successfully entered in an appropriate password length and has answered yes to at least one of the prompts for character type, they will be presented with their password in the box on the screen.
